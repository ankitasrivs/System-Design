# SOAP vs REST APIs

This document explains **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** and **REST (Representational State Transfer)**, and highlights their differences in system design.

---

## üß© SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

* **Protocol-based** standard for communication.
* Uses **XML** for request and response.
* Designed for **high security** and **transaction reliability**.
* Runs over multiple protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.).
* Common in enterprise systems (e.g., banking, telecom, payment systems).

### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Built-in **security (WS-Security)**.
* Strong **contract via WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**.
* Good for **complex, distributed enterprise apps**.
* Supports **ACID transactions**.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages

* Heavy payload (XML only).
* Slower than REST (because of strict standards and parsing).
* Complex to implement and maintain.

---

## üåç REST (Representational State Transfer)

* **Architectural style**, not a strict protocol.
* Uses standard **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
* Flexible data formats (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.), but **JSON is most common**.
* Designed for **scalability, simplicity, and performance**.
* Popular for modern **mobile apps, web apps, microservices**.

### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Lightweight (JSON or other compact formats).
* Faster and easier to cache.
* Simple to use and widely adopted.
* Works seamlessly with web browsers and mobile clients.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages

* No built-in security (relies on HTTPS, OAuth, JWT).
* No strict contract (OpenAPI/Swagger is optional).
* Not ideal for complex enterprise transactions.

## üÜö SOAP vs REST (Comparison)

| Feature           | SOAP                                                   | REST                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Type**          | Protocol                                               | Architectural style                 |
| **Data Format**   | XML only                                               | JSON (commonly), XML, YAML, etc.    |
| **Transport**     | HTTP, SMTP, TCP, more                                  | HTTP only                           |
| **Security**      | WS-Security (built-in)                                 | HTTPS + OAuth/JWT (external)        |
| **Performance**   | Slower (heavy XML)                                     | Faster (lightweight JSON)           |
| **Ease of Use**   | Complex (strict standards)                             | Simple, widely used                 |
| **Contract**      | WSDL                                                   | Optional (OpenAPI/Swagger)          |
| **Best Use Case** | Enterprise apps with high security & ACID transactions | Web, mobile, and microservices APIs |

## üéØ When to Use SOAP vs REST

* **Use SOAP** when you need **strong security, reliability, and contracts** (e.g., financial systems, payment gateways, telecom).
* **Use REST** when you need **speed, flexibility, and scalability** (e.g., iOS apps, web apps, microservices, third-party APIs).
